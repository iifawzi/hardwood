# Plan: Record Filter Arity-2 Fusion

**Status: Implemented**

## Context

Stages 1–3 of [RECORD_FILTER_COMPILATION](RECORD_FILTER_COMPILATION.md) eliminated per-row dispatch in two places: the predicate-tree interpreter (replaced by a compiled `RowMatcher` graph) and the name-keyed accessor (replaced by indexed access for flat top-level columns). The remaining cost in compound predicates is the inner virtual call inside the fixed-arity AND/OR matchers:

```java
private static final class And2Matcher implements RowMatcher {
    private final RowMatcher a, b;
    public boolean test(StructAccessor row) {
        return a.test(row) && b.test(row);
    }
}
```

When a single JVM runs many distinct query shapes through `FilteredRowReader.hasNext`, the inline cache at the inner call sites `a.test(row)` and `b.test(row)` accumulates more than two receiver classes and goes megamorphic. HotSpot can no longer fold the leaf comparison into the `And2Matcher.test` body; the leaf becomes an indirect call and per-row cost regresses by a factor of 2–3×.

This stage fuses arity-2 compound matchers into single synthetic classes per `(typeA, opA, typeB, opB, connective, accessMode)` tuple. Each fused class has the comparison hard-coded in its body — no inner virtual call. The outer site `matcher.test(row)` is still subject to megamorphism across queries, but with the inner sites gone the per-row body is direct primitive arithmetic regardless of how many shapes flow through the JVM.

## Fusion Eligibility Matrix

Both children of an `And` or `Or` node are simple primitive leaves. Fusion applies to the following type combinations.

### Same-type (different and same column)

| Type combination    | Same-column (e.g. `col >= a AND col < b`) | Different-column |
|---------------------|:-----------------------------------------:|:----------------:|
| `int + int`         | ✓                                         | ✓                |
| `long + long`       | ✓                                         | ✓                |
| `double + double`   | ✓                                         | ✓                |
| `boolean + boolean` |                                           | ✓                |
| `binary + binary`   | ✓                                         | ✓                |

Same-column fusion resolves the path and loads the value once per row, evaluating both operators against the loaded primitive. `binary + binary` same-column loads the byte-array reference once and runs two comparator calls against the two operand byte-arrays.

`boolean + boolean` same-column is omitted — with only two distinct operand values and only `EQ`/`NOT_EQ` honoured, the surface is too narrow to justify a code path.

### Cross-type numeric (different column only)

| Canonical form (after AND/OR commutativity) | Aliases handled by canonicalisation |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `int + long`                                | `long + int`                        |
| `int + double`                              | `double + int`                      |
| `long + double`                             | `double + long`                     |

Both `And` and `Or` are commutative for pure-leaf children, so both orderings dispatch to the canonical fused matcher.

### Connectives and access modes

Every combination above is implemented for:
- both `And` and `Or`,
- both name-keyed access (`StructAccessor.getX(name)`) and indexed access (`IndexedAccessor.getXAt(int)`).

For each fusion target the code emits a distinct concrete class per `(opA, opB)` pair (6 × 6 = 36 per target). Each leaf operator is `EQ`, `NOT_EQ`, `LT`, `LT_EQ`, `GT`, `GT_EQ`. Boolean leaves with operators outside `EQ`/`NOT_EQ` reduce to the legacy non-null check, matching `RecordFilterEvaluator.matchesRow`.

---

## Implementation

### New file: `internal/predicate/RecordFilterFusion.java`

Name-keyed AND and OR fusion. Public API:

```java
static RowMatcher tryFuseAnd2(ResolvedPredicate a, ResolvedPredicate b, FileSchema schema);
static RowMatcher tryFuseOr2(ResolvedPredicate a, ResolvedPredicate b, FileSchema schema);
```

Returns `null` when the pair is not eligible (caller falls back to the generic `And2Matcher` / `Or2Matcher`). Internal — package-private.

The body is a switch on `(typeA, typeB)` that dispatches to a per-combination helper. Each helper:

1. Resolves both leaves' intermediate struct paths and leaf field names at compile time.
2. If both columns have the same `columnIndex` and the type combination has a same-column variant, dispatches to a `…Range` helper that loads the value once.
3. Otherwise dispatches to a `…Diff` helper.
4. Each helper switches on `(opA, opB)` and returns one of 36 lambdas with both operators baked in as primitive comparisons.

Cross-type combinations (`int + long`, `int + double`, `long + double`) canonicalise the order before dispatching, so `(double, long)` and `(long, double)` flow through one set of 36 lambdas.

### New file: `internal/predicate/RecordFilterFusionIndexed.java`

Mirrors `RecordFilterFusion` but uses `IndexedAccessor.getXAt(int)` rather than `StructAccessor.getX(name)`. Public API:

```java
static RowMatcher tryFuseAnd2(ResolvedPredicate a, ResolvedPredicate b,
        FileSchema schema, ProjectedSchema projection);
static RowMatcher tryFuseOr2(ResolvedPredicate a, ResolvedPredicate b,
        FileSchema schema, ProjectedSchema projection);
```

Returns `null` if either leaf is non-top-level (path length > 1) or the pair is not eligible. Top-level column indices are translated to projected indices at compile time.

### Modify `internal/predicate/RecordFilterCompiler.java`

`compileAnd` and `compileOr` consult fusion before falling back to the generic fixed-arity matchers when `children.size() == 2`:

```java
private static RowMatcher compileAnd(List<ResolvedPredicate> children, FileSchema schema,
        ProjectedSchema projection) {
    if (FUSION_ENABLED && children.size() == 2) {
        if (projection != null) {
            RowMatcher fused = RecordFilterFusionIndexed.tryFuseAnd2(
                    children.get(0), children.get(1), schema, projection);
            if (fused != null) return fused;
        }
        RowMatcher fused = RecordFilterFusion.tryFuseAnd2(
                children.get(0), children.get(1), schema);
        if (fused != null) return fused;
    }
    RowMatcher[] compiled = compileAll(children, schema, projection);
    return switch (compiled.length) { /* unchanged */ };
}
```

`compileOr` follows the same shape against `tryFuseOr2`. Arity ≥ 3 falls back to the existing fixed-arity / generic matchers regardless of fusion.

### Disable flag

A static `boolean FUSION_ENABLED` is read once at class init from the system property `hardwood.recordfilter.fusion`. Default `true`; set `-Dhardwood.recordfilter.fusion=false` to disable. Internal-only knob, used by benchmarks to A/B the fusion contribution. Not part of the public API.

### Why each tuple is a distinct concrete class

Fusion only works because each `(typeA, opA, typeB, opB, connective, accessMode)` produces a *distinct concrete class*. The outer call site `matcher.test(row)` is permitted to be megamorphic — what matters is that the body of each fused matcher contains no virtual call that itself goes megamorphic. Any shared dispatch point inside the body (a `BiPredicate` field, a `Comparator`, a generic helper that takes the operator as a parameter) would defeat fusion: HotSpot cannot fold a comparison through a megamorphic call.

For this reason, every operator pair within every type combination is hand-written as its own lambda. Mechanical repetition is the cost of avoiding the inner dispatch.

---

## Null and NaN Semantics

Fused matchers preserve `RecordFilterEvaluator.matchesRow` semantics exactly:

- A leaf whose intermediate struct path is null returns false. The fused body checks `resolve(row, path) == null` before any value access (name-keyed) or relies on `IndexedAccessor`'s flat top-level guarantee that the row reference itself is non-null (indexed).
- A leaf whose direct field is null returns false. Fused bodies check `accessor.isNull(name)` / `isNullAt(index)` before reading the primitive.
- AND fusion short-circuits on the first false — the body uses `&&` between the two leaves.
- OR fusion short-circuits on the first true — the body uses `||`. When leaf A is null/false, leaf B is still evaluated.
- Float and double comparisons use `Float.compare` / `Double.compare`, matching the legacy NaN ordering used by the per-leaf factories in `RecordFilterCompiler`.
- Binary comparisons honour the per-leaf `signed` flag captured at compile time. Same-column binary fusion may have only one effective `signed` value (it is a column property), but the two flags are baked independently for diff-column fusion.

---

## Testing

### Equivalence — `core/src/test/java/dev/hardwood/internal/predicate/RecordFilterFusionTest.java` (new)

Three-way equivalence check. For every fused (combo × connective × opA × opB × same-column / different-column × null / non-null leaf value) tuple:

1. Build a stub row implementing `StructAccessor` (and `IndexedAccessor` where applicable).
2. Compile the predicate three ways:
    - Through `RecordFilterCompiler.compile` with fusion enabled (the fused matcher).
    - Through `RecordFilterCompiler.compile` with `-Dhardwood.recordfilter.fusion=false` (the generic `And2Matcher` / `Or2Matcher` over name-keyed leaves).
    - Through `RecordFilterEvaluator.matchesRow` (the legacy oracle).
3. Assert all three return the same boolean.

### Existing tests

- `RecordFilterCompilerTest` (Stage 1) and `RecordFilterIndexedTest` (Stage 3) continue to pass unchanged — fusion is transparent when the legacy oracle is used as the equivalence reference.
- `./mvnw verify` continues to pass; no public API changes.

---

## Benchmarks

Two artifacts target the megamorphic regime that motivates this stage.

### JMH micro — `RecordFilterMegamorphicBenchmark`

Path: `performance-testing/micro-benchmarks/src/main/java/dev/hardwood/benchmarks/RecordFilterMegamorphicBenchmark.java` (new).

Setup constructs ~12 distinct arity-2 predicate shapes covering every fusion combo × connective:

- `id BETWEEN a AND b` (long+long same-column AND)
- `tag BETWEEN x AND y` (int+int same-column AND)
- `value BETWEEN v1 AND v2` (double+double same-column AND)
- `id < a OR id > b` (long+long same-column OR)
- `tag == x OR tag == y` (int+int same-column OR)
- `id >= a AND value < v` (long+double diff-column AND)
- `tag < x AND value < v` (int+double diff-column AND)
- `id < a AND tag > x` (int+long diff-column AND)
- `id >= a OR value < v` (long+double diff-column OR)
- `tag <= x OR id > a` (int+long diff-column OR)
- `flag == true AND flag == false` (boolean+boolean diff-column AND, degenerate)
- `bin >= "abc" AND bin < "xyz"` (binary+binary same-column AND)

Two arms, both iterating BATCH_SIZE rows × all shapes per `@Benchmark` invocation:

- `fusedMegamorphic` — matchers compiled with fusion enabled. Each matcher is a unique synthetic class; the outer site sees N receiver types but each body has no inner virtual call.
- `genericMegamorphic` — matchers compiled with `-Dhardwood.recordfilter.fusion=false`. Each matcher is a `Generic AndN/OrN`, all sharing the same inner `a.test(row)` / `b.test(row)` bytecode locations, which accumulate the leaf classes and go megamorphic.

`@OperationsPerInvocation(BATCH_SIZE * SHAPE_COUNT)` so reported `ns/op` is per-row-per-shape cost.

### End-to-end — `RecordFilterMegamorphicEndToEndTest`

Path: `performance-testing/end-to-end/src/test/java/dev/hardwood/perf/RecordFilterMegamorphicEndToEndTest.java` (new).

Lazy-generates `target/record_filter_megamorphic.parquet` (10M rows, schema `id long, value double, tag int, flag boolean, bin binary`) on first run. Same generation pattern as the existing `RecordFilterBenchmarkTest`, extended with three additional columns.

The test runs the same ~12 query shapes as the JMH benchmark through `ParquetFileReader.buildRowReader().filter(...).build()`, sequentially in the same JVM, multiple iterations (`-Dperf.runs`, default 5). The point is to drive `FilteredRowReader.hasNext`'s outer call site to ≥12 receiver classes — every shape contributes one fused class with fusion on, or shares the small set of generic `AndN`/`OrN` classes with fusion off (where the inner sites carry the megamorphism instead).

Two modes per query, controlled by the system property:

- `-Dhardwood.recordfilter.fusion=true` (default): fused matchers.
- `-Dhardwood.recordfilter.fusion=false`: generic matchers.

The harness runs all shapes under each mode (separate JVM invocations recommended in CI to keep code-cache state isolated), captures wall time per shape, and prints a side-by-side comparison plus aggregate throughput.

## Risks and Edge Cases

- **Cast safety in indexed fusion.** Indexed leaves cast the row to `IndexedAccessor`. The cast is safe by construction — `RecordFilterFusionIndexed.tryFuseAnd2` / `tryFuseOr2` is reached only via the projection-aware `RecordFilterCompiler.compile` overload, which is only invoked from `FlatRowReader` (which `implements IndexedAccessor`). Same contract as the indexed leaves introduced in Stage 3.
- **Canonicalisation correctness.** Cross-type AND/OR canonicalisation relies on commutativity. Both `And` and `Or` are commutative regardless of leaf order or null-yielding leaves; the legacy evaluator uses the same commutative semantics via short-circuit on first match/miss. Three-way equivalence tests cover both orderings.
- **Same-column fusion of intermediate struct paths.** Fusion is allowed for same-column same-type when both leaves resolve identical intermediate struct paths. Different paths (e.g. `outer.x` and `inner.x`) compare by `columnIndex`, which is unique per leaf in the file schema, so the same-column branch only fires when the actual physical column matches.
- **Outer-site megamorphism.** Stage 4 does not eliminate megamorphism at `FilteredRowReader.hasNext`'s `matcher.test(row)` site. The cost is bounded — one inline-cache miss per row instead of three — and is largely hidden for long single-query scans by C2's speculative inlining. Workloads that rapidly interleave many short queries pay more. See _Future work_ below.

---

## Future Work

### Option B — Wider type and predicate matrix

Add fusion for: `float + float` (same and diff column), `float + numeric` cross-type, binary cross-type with numeric, `IsNull` / `IsNotNull` paired with any leaf type. Each addition follows the same 36-lambda-per-target pattern.

### Option C — Reduced scope

If maintenance cost ever outweighs the megamorphism benefit for the cross-type combos, the matrix can be trimmed back to same-type only (`int+int`, `long+long`, `double+double`, `boolean+boolean`, `binary+binary`) with no behavioural impact other than slower per-row cost on cross-type predicates.

### Stage 5 — Eliminate outer-site megamorphism via reader specialisation

The residual outer-site megamorphism at `FilteredRowReader.hasNext` is the next bottleneck for workloads with many interleaved short queries. Three mitigations exist:

1. **`-XX:TypeProfileWidth=8`**. Raises HotSpot's bimorphic-to-megamorphic threshold. Free runtime tuning, helps up to ~8 shapes. Documented as a deployment knob.
2. **Per-query reader specialisation**. Generate a bespoke `FilteredRowReader` subclass per query whose `hasNext` body has the fused matcher comparison inlined directly. Each query then has its own bytecode location for the matcher call, monomorphic by construction. Requires runtime bytecode generation (`ClassFile API` or ASM).
3. **Iteration inversion**. Move the `while (delegate.hasNext()) delegate.next(); test(...)` loop into the matcher itself, with `runScan(delegate, consumer)` overridden per fused class. Self-calls within each generated class devirtualise. Combinatorial explosion unless paired with code generation.

Option 1 is a deployment change. Options 2 and 3 are larger, separate stages.

### Code-generation alternative for the fusion source

Each fused matcher's source is mechanical, and the file is large (~4000–5000 lines for the matrix above). Hand-writing is the chosen mechanism for now: stack traces point at real source, the build is unaffected, and the file is rarely edited once the matrix is settled. If the matrix grows substantially (e.g. into Option B), a build-time generator that emits the same bytecode shape from a template + table is a natural refactor. The template language would need to preserve the per-tuple distinct-concrete-class property described in _Implementation_; any approach that introduces a shared dispatch point inside the body would defeat fusion.

## Results

Hardware: macOS aarch64 (Apple Silicon), Oracle JDK 25.0.3, Maven wrapper 3.9.12.

### JMH micro — `RecordFilterMegamorphicBenchmark`

2 forks × 5 warmup × 5 measurement iterations (default JMH config). The
benchmark runs 12 distinct fused (combo × connective) shapes against a
4096-row in-memory batch in two arms: `fusedMegamorphic` compiles each
matcher through `RecordFilterCompiler` with fusion enabled (each shape
yields a unique synthetic class — outer site megamorphic, body inlined),
and `genericMegamorphic` builds a generic `and2`/`or2` envelope around
each leaf pair so the inner `a.test()` / `b.test()` sites also accumulate
12 receiver classes and go megamorphic. `ns/op` is per row × per shape.

| Shape mix (12 fused tuples)         | Generic ns/op | Fused ns/op | Speedup |
|-------------------------------------|--------------:|------------:|--------:|
| Aggregate (avgt over all 12 shapes) | 5.298 ± 0.087 | **3.014 ± 0.014** | **1.76×** |

The fused arm holds steady at ~3 ns/op even with 12 distinct receiver
classes flowing through the outer site. The generic arm pays an
additional ~2.3 ns/row for the inner-site megamorphism that fusion
eliminates.

### End-to-end — `RecordFilterMegamorphicEndToEndTest`

10M-row Parquet file, schema `(id long, value double, tag int, flag boolean,
bin string)`, 5 measurement runs per shape. Same 12 query shapes as the JMH
micro, executed sequentially through `ParquetFileReader.buildRowReader()`.
Two separate JVM invocations — one with `-Dhardwood.recordfilter.fusion=true`,
one with `=false` — to keep the static `FUSION_ENABLED` flag clean.

| Shape                                                 | Generic ms | Fused ms | Speedup |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------:|---------:|--------:|
| `id BETWEEN 1M and 4M` (long+long AND)                |       30.7 |     14.1 |   2.18× |
| `id < 500K OR id > 9.5M` (long+long OR)               |       10.6 |      9.2 |   1.15× |
| `tag BETWEEN 0 and 50` (int+int AND)                  |      120.8 |     69.9 |   1.73× |
| `tag = 5 OR tag = 47` (int+int OR)                    |       58.0 |     42.3 |   1.37× |
| `value BETWEEN 0 and 500` (double+double AND)         |      126.7 |     83.7 |   1.51× |
| `id < 5M AND value < 500` (long+double AND)           |       61.4 |     48.7 |   1.26× |
| `id < 5M OR value > 500` (long+double OR)             |       72.7 |     69.4 |   1.05× |
| `tag < 50 AND id > 5M` (int+long AND)                 |       51.3 |     39.6 |   1.30× |
| `tag < 50 AND value < 500` (int+double AND)           |      120.0 |     98.0 |   1.22× |
| `flag = true AND flag != false` (boolean+boolean AND) |       99.4 |     75.7 |   1.31× |
| `value > 0 AND id < 9999` (double+long AND, swap)     |        1.0 |      0.9 |   1.11× |
| `bin BETWEEN k200 and k800` (binary+binary AND)       |      178.5 |    103.6 |   1.72× |
| **Aggregate (60 shape×run combinations)**             | **4655.7** | **3276.0** | **1.42×** |

Largest wins are on the same-column AND BETWEEN shapes (long, int,
double, binary) — the legacy generic path pays for two megamorphic inner
sites per row, while the fused matcher loads the value once and runs both
comparisons inline. Smallest wins are on shapes whose body cost is
already dominated by I/O or page decoding — the canonical-swap shape
matches only ~0.1 % of rows so the per-row matcher cost is amortized
into noise. The aggregate **42 % wall-clock reduction** holds even though
several shapes traverse 10M rows where decode time is non-trivial.

### Why the gap stays under 2× end-to-end

The JMH micro isolates dispatch and shows the body-only win (1.76×); end-to-end
those 2.3 ns/row are competing with decode, projection, and reader plumbing.
The remaining cost is dominated by the residual outer-site megamorphism at
`FilteredRowReader.hasNext` and by the page-decode pipeline — see the
*Future work* section for Stage 5 directions targeting the outer site.
