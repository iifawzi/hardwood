/// preserving field-access optimizations on the flat hot path.
///
/// Nested batches are allocated and managed by [NestedColumnWorker]'s drain
/// thread and published through a `BatchExchange<NestedBatch>`.
///
/// **Polarity:** validity bitmaps carry set-bit-= -present semantics. A
/// `null` reference is the sparse representation of "every item at that
/// scope is present in this batch."
///
/// `multiLevelOffsets[k]` is **layer-indexed** — one slot per `STRUCT` /
/// `REPEATED` layer, with `STRUCT` slots holding `null` (no offsets) and
/// `REPEATED` slots holding sentinel-suffixed offsets: length
/// `count(k) + 1`, with the final entry equal to the count at the next
/// inner level (or [#valueCount] for the innermost).
